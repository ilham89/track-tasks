React Trello Clone
===========================

This a project I wanted to make as a tribute to Trello and to showcase some basic skills. The
project is built with React.js, Firebase, Sass and can be viewd [here](https://react-trello-clone-42c7f.web.app/).

## Functionality
The app allows you to create boards, which you can create an infinite number of lists. Each list can contain an infinite number of cards which can for example be 'todos'. You can create a kanban system to track productivity and can move cards into the 'Completed' list or just remove the cards when done. Each card needs to have a title and in addition you have the option to add a description.

## Getting Started
The app can be installed by cloning the Git repository and running 'npm install' in the project directory. Once all packages are installed, you can run 'npm start' to run the app in localhost.

## Prerequisites
You will need to have node and npm installed.
